# automaticCurtains
In this project we use a stepper motor and an ldr attached to a raspberry pi to have a system that can open and close curtains at predetermined times and also according to whether it is dark outside.
Due to not having access to a setup that I can attach the motor to, I will be using a top of the line cardboard recreation.
